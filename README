===[ What is it ? ]===

pywii helps you to easily create interaction between your wiimote and
your PC. For the moment, it only works on *nix with python 2.5+

===[ Description ]===

This simple tool was basically written because I'm lazy,
and is purposed to make a bit of fun with your wiimote
allowing to interact (simply) with your system. Some events
(buttons pressing, wiimote moves) can be match to perform a
specific action on your system.

Up to 4 Wiimotes can be used simultaneously (but I don't see
the point in that :) ).


===[ Quick Start ]===

(Check your bluetoothd daemon is active)

$ cd /path/to/pywii/dir
$ (emacs|vim) pywii.rc  # <- edit your configuration to adapt it to your system
$ python pywii -f ./pywii.rc

Enjoy
